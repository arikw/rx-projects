/** Featured-sort tiebreaker for projects NOT pinned in `config.featured`.
 *  A weighted "quality" score, mostly 0–~250. Higher = earlier in the
 *  default grid. The sort itself uses this score directly (highest first,
 *  title alphabetic as a final deterministic break) — no bucketing or
 *  group-key tricks, so popularity is allowed to clearly dominate when
 *  there's a meaningful gap, even between same-source-and-year projects.
 *
 *  Weight philosophy:
 *  - Big binary signals (installable, visual richness) carry the most
 *    weight because they're effort + intent signals.
 *  - Popularity is log-scaled but with a higher multiplier than the
 *    other signals — at 1K downloads it's already worth more than a
 *    homepage, by 100K it's worth more than the whole visual stack.
 *  - Recency is intentionally a small bonus (max 15) so a 2026 project
 *    doesn't out-score a 2018 project on age alone.
 *  - Retired projects get a 15% discount, not a 100% one — substantial
 *    retired work (lots of downloads + real visuals) still beats plain
 *    live-but-empty repos.
 *
 *  The formula is intentionally simple — it's a default for the
 *  "Featured" sort, not a ranking system. Cloners who want different
 *  weights edit this file. */
