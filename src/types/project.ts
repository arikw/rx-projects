 *
 * Additivity (how the builder combines a metric across a project's sources):
 *  - `stars`, `forks`, `downloads`, `installs`, `users` — additive (summed).
 *  - `rating` — reconciled within a single origin (mirrors all describe the
 *    same audience, so the best signal wins); summed across DIFFERENT origin
 *    resources (e.g. a Firefox port + a Chrome port merged via
 *    `relatesToProjectId` — those are distinct audiences). Histograms combine
